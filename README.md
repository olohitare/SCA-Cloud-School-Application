# SCA-Cloud-School-Application

Python code for software installation.

This is a multiplatform solution as the Command Line Interface takes into account the possible OS from which the program will be run.
All commands were routed based on the platform type.

No output is on the screen when checking for the commands.
The application checks for the operating system of the compute in use and also, if the specified applications: wget, curl and node.js are already intsalled.
It terminates if they are already installed or it goes right ahead to intall them if they are not.
